2. Environment Setup

Copy the .env.example file to .env.local:
bash       cp .env.example .env.local       
Fill in your API keys and other environment variables in .env.local. Never commit .env.local to GitHub. Key variables to set: ```env # Database (adjust for your local setup or Vercel Postgres later) DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_DB_USER:YOUR_DB_PASSWORD@YOUR_DB_HOST:5432/epic_tech_ai_db"

  NONKYC_API_SECRET_1="YOUR_NONKYC_API_SECRET_1"
  NONKYC_API_KEY_2="YOUR_NONKYC_API_KEY_2"
  NONKYC_API_SECRET_2="YOUR_NONKYC_API_SECRET_2"

  # Coinbase API Key
  COINBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_COINBASE_API_KEY"
  COINBASE_API_PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_COINBASE_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM_FORMAT"
  COINBASE_USER_ID="YOUR_COINBASE_USER_ID"

  # Nvidia API Keys (1 & 2)
  NVIDIA_API_KEY_1="YOUR_NVIDIA_API_KEY_1"
  NVIDIA_API_KEY_2="YOUR_NVIDIA_API_KEY_2"

  # Vercel Integration API Keys (1, 2 & 3) - For potential programmatic Vercel interaction if needed
  VERCEL_API_KEY_1="YOUR_VERCEL_API_KEY_1"
  VERCEL_API_KEY_2="YOUR_VERCEL_API_KEY_2"
  VERCEL_API_KEY_3="YOUR_VERCEL_API_KEY_3"

  # Ngrok API Key
  NGROK_API_KEY="YOUR_NGROK_API_KEY"

  AI_TUTOR_OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_AI_TUTOR_OPENAI_KEY"
  AI_TUTOR_GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_AI_TUTOR_GROQ_KEY"
  ```
3. Database Setup (using Prisma)

# Generate Prisma client (usually runs automatically after npm install via postinstall script)
npx prisma generate

# Apply database schema changes (creates tables based on schema.prisma)
npx prisma db push 

# Optional: Seed database with initial data (if a seed script is created)
# npx prisma db seed
4. Run Development Server

npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

🔧 Configuration Details

Stripe Integration:

Your primary subscription link: https://buy.stripe.com/7sI3dlgcQ4uL0gMeUW (This will be linked from the app).
Webhook Setup (Crucial for production):
Go to your Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks.
Click "Add endpoint".
Endpoint URL: https://YOUR_DEPLOYED_DOMAIN.com/api/webhooks/stripe (e.g., your Vercel URL). For local testing, you might use Stripe CLI or ngrok.
Select events to listen to (as per your original README):
customer.subscription.created
customer.subscription.updated
customer.subscription.deleted
invoice.payment_succeeded
invoice.payment_failed
Copy the "Signing secret" for this webhook and set it as STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in your .env.local.
AI Providers:

The platform is designed to be extensible. Initially, OpenAI (GPT, DALL-E) will be the focus.
Add API keys to .env.local to enable other providers as they are integrated.
📦 Deployment (Vercel Recommended)

Push to Your GitHub Repository:

# (Assuming you've already cloned, added files, and committed)
git push origin main
Deploy to Vercel:

Sign up or log in to Vercel.
Click "Add New..." → "Project".
Import your GitHub repository (epictechai/epic-tech-ai-engineering).
Vercel should auto-detect it as a Next.js project.
Configure Environment Variables: Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables on Vercel and add all the variables from your .env.local file. This is critical for production.
Deploy.
Production Database Setup (Vercel Postgres Example):

In Vercel, go to the "Storage" tab of your project and create a new PostgreSQL database.
Vercel will provide a DATABASE_URL. Update this environment variable in your Vercel project settings.
After deployment, you might need to run Prisma migrations against the production database. This can often be done by adding a postinstall script in package.json that includes prisma migrate deploy or by running it manually via Vercel CLI or a one-off job if Vercel supports it for your plan. A common approach is npx prisma migrate deploy in the build command or a separate release phase script. For now, npx prisma db push is simpler for initial setup.
🎯 Usage (Once Deployed & Subscribed)

Subscribe: Users will click a "Get Started" or "Subscribe" button, which will redirect to your Stripe payment link.
Access Dashboard: After successful subscription (verified via webhook or by checking Stripe status), users gain access to the AI generation dashboard.
Generate Content: Use the intuitive interface to request various types of media.
Download/Share: Save or share generated content.
🔒 Security Considerations

Authentication: NextAuth.js for secure user sessions.
API Protection: API routes should be protected, ensuring only authenticated and subscribed users can access generation features.
Rate Limiting: Implement usage tracking and consider rate limiting to prevent abuse and manage costs.
Webhook Verification: Always verify Stripe webhook signatures.
📊 Monitoring & Analytics (Future)

Track user generations, popular features, and potential errors.
Integrate analytics for user engagement.
🛣 Roadmap (High-Level Vision)

Advanced AI Models: Integrate GPT-4 Vision, Claude 3, Gemini, etc.
Music Generation: Explore Suno AI, MusicLM, or similar integrations.
Video Generation: Look into RunwayML, Pika Labs, etc.
Developer API: Offer API access for external integrations (could be a higher tier).
Team Features: Collaboration, shared projects, and multi-user accounts.
Custom Model Support: Allow users to use fine-tuned models (advanced).
Mobile App: Potential React Native companion app.
💰 Monetization

Primary Subscription Model:
Pro Plan: (e.g., $29/month, using your Stripe link: https://buy.stripe.com/7sI3dlgcQ4uL0gMeUW)
Features: Unrestricted generation types (within fair use), priority processing, potential API access.
